# Calculatorapp
This project is a basic calculator app built using Python and Tkinter, a library for creating graphical user interfaces. With this calculator, you can do math calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
1. Started by importing the required libraries, which in this case, include tkinter for the GUI components and functions, as well as eval for evaluating mathematical expressions.
2. Createed a main application window by initializing a Tkinter object. This window will contain all the GUI elements for your calculator.
3. Created an Entry widget to allow users to input mathematical expressions and display the results. Created it and defined its properties, such as its width and position.
4. Createed functions for various calculator operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions should update the Entry widget with the result.
5. Designed a grid of buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /). Attach the respective functions to each button.
